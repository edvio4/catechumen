## Description
My Catechumen app is a homeschool curriculum planning app. This app will help parents keep track what books each student is studying.  It also allows parents to plan the pace of teaching through a book.  This is perhaps it's most useful feature because if a parents wants to finish a book by a given date, this app will help them plan how many lessons and on which days of the week should the parent teach that book.

Being a homeschool parent is already a daunting task so this app will hopefully take the guessing out of planning a student's school year.
